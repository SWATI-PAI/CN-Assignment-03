Question:We had to find a solution for question number 02(section A)

In this question we have to have 2machines A and B.
Machine A pings request to B. It will send a message/sec and it will do it for 1min continuously.
After a min it will stop sending the message for 30sec.

B implements rate limit (Rate limit is used to control the amount of incoming and outgoing traffic into and from a network.)
using the j-drop for A---- drops only echo reply and not the request.

Now we will ping from another machine(in our program we have taken it as 127.0.0.1) which will 
send 1message/sec in which no packet drop will occur.

Computing X and Y:
In our team the lowest USN is 71.
Therefore, D=71 and X= D+10 = 71+10 = 81
Y =X/2 = 81/2 = 40.5 ~ 40

Port number for macjine A and machine B:
For machine A: 20000+X = 20000+81 = 20018
For machine B: 20000+Y = 20000+40 = 20040 

The program that we have implemented has some errors and needs to be further implemented.
But we have done everything what we were able to understand.

Difficulties faced:
we had to go through many websites to understand how ping exactly works .
we also had to understand rate limit and what j-drop was and their working.
